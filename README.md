## Motivation

Food in India is no longer restricted to a home-made thing. With food delivery service like Zomato, restaurant's customer reach have widened. In a busy city like Banglaore, people are heavily reliant on food delivery option. Thus food business in Bangalore is quite big. It becomes very useful to study the food preferences of the people, identify locations on food demands and understand different restaurant arrangements. This helps us to know the market of food business in Bangalore.
